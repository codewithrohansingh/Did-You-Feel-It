# Did-You-Feel-It
This application make the HTTP request to the server and get the response which is then parse to object and then screen shows the information about a earthquake.
Making the Network request in the background thread by Using the ASYNCTASK CLASS.
By using AsyncTask class we DO NOT BLOCK THE UI THREAD.
**CAUTION** Add the network permission  in the manifest file.(For this check out the manifest file).
AsyncTask Class has a drawback, so to over come this draw back check out my new project name - "EarthQuake application".
NETWORK REQUEST, READING THE INPUT STREAM , PARSING THE JSON RESPONSE IN DESIRED OBJECT , USING ASYNC TASK TO USE BACKGROUND THREAD.
